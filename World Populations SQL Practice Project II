In this project, you’ll answer questions using a database of world population by country.

There are two tables:

countries , population_years

/**

**/

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM countries
WHERE continent = 'Africa';

/**
Question: What was the total population of the continent of Oceania in 2005?

SELECT continent, 
ROUND(SUM(population),2) AS 'Total Population Oceania: 2005', year
FROM countries
JOIN population_years ON
countries.id = population_years.country_id
WHERE continent = 'Oceania' AND year = '2005';

/**

countries.id = population_years.country_id
WHERE continent = 'South America' AND year = '2003';

/**
Question: What country had the smallest population in 2007?

**/

SELECT countries.name,
